# How React SSR Works
A repo containing small micro apps that implement SSR for react.

This code was created as part of my learning journey, so it's not detailed as code written for a tutorial.


## Technologies
- React & Typescript
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for build system and code bundler.
  - vite has SSR support
  - its a proven build tool used by Astro, SvelteKit, SolidStart, Qwik, Marko, Vue and many other frameworks.
